            <p>EU Code Week is a grass-root movement run by volunteers who promote coding in their countries as <a
                        href="http://events.codeweek.eu/ambassadors">Code Week Ambassadors</a>. Anyone – schools,
                teachers,
                libraries, code clubs, businesses, public authorities – can organise a #CodeEU event and add it to the
                <a
                        href="http://codeweek.eu/">codeweek.eu</a> map. To make organising and running coding events
                easier, we
                have prepared different toolkits and selected some of the best lesson plans, guides and other resources.

                    Technology has a language. It’s called code. At Apple we believe coding is an essential skill.
                    Learning to
                    code teaches you how to solve problems and work together in creative ways. And it helps you build
                    apps that
                    bring your ideas to life. We think everyone should have the opportunity to create something that can
                    change
                    the world. So Apple had designed a programme that lets anyone learn, write and teach code.
